# AStar-AI-Project
A* algorithm implementation on the Palestine map to calculate the shortest distance to go from one city to another,
The implementation of the Breadth First Search algorithm, Where it takes the same path. As BFS considers the given graph unweighted and only looks for the shortest path 
considering the least number of edges to go through.
Then we compare the time taken for both algorithms, the actual distance we needed to go through if we add the distance of the BFS path.
